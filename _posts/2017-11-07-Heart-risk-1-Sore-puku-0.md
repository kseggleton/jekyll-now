title: Heart risk 1 Sore puku 0
---
In my poem *Heart risk 1 v Sore puku 0*, that was published on [Corpus](https://corpus.nz/heart-risk-1-sore-puku-0/), I wanted to capture the tension between the demands of health funders, who concentrate on specific health targets, and the needs of patients who present to the iwi health clinic that I work at. I have a real concern that taking a target based approach can lead to [unintended consequences](http://www.annfammed.org/content/15/3/255.full). The poem potrays this unintended consequence as a disconnection between patient and doctor and the loss of trust.

**Heart risk 1 v Sore puku 0**

> Everyone over 20% heart risk needs pills,  
> is what the experts told me.  
> A little heart shaped one to thin out your blood,  
> a little white one to drop your pressure,  
> and a little oval one to clean out your tubes
> is what I told my patient.  
> …But I only have a sore puku,  
> is what my patient told me.

> You are doing a good job by talking about pills,
> is what the experts told me.  
> Your heart might explode so keep taking the pills,  
> is what I told my patient.  
> …But the little heart one makes me bruise  
> and the little white one makes me dizzy  
> and the little oval one makes me ache  
> is what my patient told me.  

> Don’t forget to check for diabetes, ask about smoking and offer a flu jab  
> is what the experts told me.  
> Sugar is eating your veins  
> and smoke is blocking them up  
> and the flu might kill you
> is what I told my patient
> …But I really came in about my sore puku,  
> is what my patient told me.  

> Your numbers aren’t great you need to do more smears,  
> is what the experts told me.   
> I know that you are a man but have you considered a smear?  
> Is what I told my patient.  
> …I don’t think I want to see you again,
> you haven’t asked about my sore puku,
> is what my patient told me.
