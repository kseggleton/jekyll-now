[Wells, S., Rafter, N., **Eggleton, K.**, Turner, C., Huang, Y., & Bullen, C. (2016). Using run charts for cardiovascular disease risk assessments in general practice. *Journal of Primary Health Care*, *8*(2), 172-178. doi:10.1071/HC15030](http://www.publish.csiro.au/?act=view_file&file_id=HC15030.pdf)

Run charts are a quality improvement tool. Within this non-randomised observational study run charts were used to support team processes in reaching CVD risk assessment targets. The study showed that although run charts were easy to use and valued by staff, they did not make a difference in increasing assessment rates. This was likely due to national targets driving performance at the time of the study.
